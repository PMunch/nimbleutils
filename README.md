# Nimbleutils

Utilities for working with Nimble packages. Currently offers a single procedure
`getPackage` which runs `nimble dump` and parses the entire output into a useful
object. This can be used to discover information about a package.

The idea of this package is to collect more useful procedures to work with
Nimble packages. If you have a cool Nimble hack lying around please contribute.
